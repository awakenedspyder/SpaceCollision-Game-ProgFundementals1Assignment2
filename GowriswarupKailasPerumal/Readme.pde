Brief description of the animation achieved:
        This is a Game titled "Space Collision". The basic instructions are as follows:
          (i)   Use the Up/Down Arrows to Move the SpaceCraft Up or Down. 
          (ii)  Avoid the Red Obstacles to score points. Getting hit by one results in a life lost. Avoiding hits results in a point scored each time. 
          (iii) Catch the Blue objects to score 10 points each time. Missing one would result in a life lost.
       The spaceship colours are changed every time the program is loaded.
       At the end of the game, the final score is displayed, along with the Score streaks, i.e the points scored in each life. Total number of lives is 10. (use of Arrays)
       The highest, lowest and average life streaks are also displayed. (array calculations)
